Install — step-by-step
This section covers typical install steps for a machine and for a bulk deploy.

Single machine install
1. Visit the Releases page and download the installer package. The file on the Releases page needs to be downloaded and executed. Link: https://github.com/princeyvan10/-AutoCAD-2025/releases
2. Run the installer with admin rights.
3. Choose install type: Typical or Custom.
4. If you select Custom, choose components and installation path.
5. Accept license terms.
6. Complete install. Restart if prompted.
7. Launch the app. Sign in or provide license key as prompted.

Deploy via network or offline
1. Extract the full installer package on a share that client machines can reach.
2. Run the installer with silent options for unattended installs.
3. Use a configuration file to set license server and include required add-ons.
4. Validate install by launching AutoCAD and opening a test DWG.

Offline setup and offline activation
This section covers steps to set up AutoCAD in an offline environment and common practices to prepare offline installers.

Create an offline installer
- Download the full package from Releases to a network location.
- Copy the package to an external drive.
- Use the vendor's official offline installer options for customization.
- Ensure all required add-ons and libraries are included.

Offline activation flow
- Obtain an activation code or offline activation file from your license portal.
- Apply the activation inside the application per vendor instructions.
- For floating licenses, set up a local license server on a reachable host on your network.
- Test activation on an offline machine before broad rollout.

Quick start: first drawings and templates
Project setup
- Create a project folder structure: /Drawings, /Sheets, /Xrefs, /Renders, /Scripts.
- Place templates (.dwt) and standards (.dws) in a shared location.
- Create a template per project type: architectural, mechanical, electrical.

Essential templates
- 2D architectural plan template (A1, A3 sheet sizes, layers preset).
- Mechanical part template with dimension styles.
- Electrical schematics template with symbol libraries.
- BIM export template for downstream tools.

Open and save
- Use Save As to create versioned copies.
- Use DWG files with clear names: Project_Component_YYYYMMDD.dwg.
- Keep a master drawing with Xrefs for large projects.

2D drafting workflow
Start with setup
- Set units and limits early.
- Configure grid and snap to project needs.
- Load template with preconfigured layers and styles.

Layer strategy
- Follow a layer naming scheme: discipline-type-function (e.g., ARCH-WALL-INT).
- Lock layers that you do not edit.
- Set color and linetype by layer.

Drawing tools
- Use Polyline for complex linework.
- Use Offset and Trim for fast geometry edits.
- Use Fillet and Chamfer for corner control.
- Use Hatch for material fills.

Dimensioning
- Create dimension styles for each project scale.
- Use Annotative dimensions for multiple scales.
- Keep text height consistent across sheets.

Blocks and dynamic blocks
- Convert repetitive geometry into blocks.
- Use attributes for data attached to blocks (e.g., part number).
- Use dynamic blocks for adjustable geometry and grips.

3D modeling workflow
Modeling basics
- Start with a base plane and build solids or surfaces.
- Use Extrude, Revolve, Sweep, and Loft for primary shapes.
- Use Boolean operations for unions and subtractions.

Coordinate systems
- Use UCS command to orient modeling work to feature planes.
- Keep world UCS stable for final output.

Visual styles and materials
- Assign materials for realistic renders.
- Switch visual style to Shaded or Realistic for quick checks.
- Use Viewports for multiple views on a single layout.

Meshes and surfaces
- Use meshes for concept shapes.
- Convert meshes to solids for fabrication if required.
- Use surface tools for complex freeform shapes.

Rendering and presentation
- Use viewport settings and lights for final renders.
- Use the renderer linked to GPU for final images.
- Use render presets to keep consistent output.

Blocks, Xrefs, and file management
Xrefs
- Use Xrefs for assembly-style management.
- Bind externally when you need to create a single file.
- Use Overlay vs. Attachment depending on inheritance needs.

External resources
- Store shared resources on a network path using UNC.
- Map fonts and plot style references in project settings.

File naming and versions
- Use a versioning scheme that matches your workflow.
- Keep a master copy and a working copy per user.
- Use a change log file inside the project folder.

Layers, properties, and standards
Layer standards
- Document layer naming and color guides.
- Use a standard .dws file and enforce via project process.

Object properties
- Use the properties palette to set materials and metadata.
- Use attributes in blocks to store part metadata.

Standards compliance
- Use standards checker to keep files consistent.
- Automate fixes with scripts where possible.

Annotation and dimensioning best practices
Text styles
- Create text styles for note types and scales.
- Use annotative text to control size across viewports.

Dimensions
- Use dimension styles for linear, angular, radial, and ordinate dims.
- Use associative dimensions to keep dims linked to geometry.

Multileaders
- Use multileaders for callouts with style presets.
- Keep leader styles consistent across sheets.

Tables
- Use tables to list parts and schedules.
- Link tables to external data where possible.

Printing and plotting
Plot styles
- Use named plot styles (.ctb or .stb) per project standard.
- Maintain a plot style library.

Layouts and viewports
- Use layouts for final sheet composition.
- Create viewports with locked scale.
- Use multiple layouts for revision sets.

Batch plotting
- Use Batch Plot or Publish to output multiple sheets.
- Use PDF/plot drivers for digital sharing.

Scripting and automation (LISP, Script, .NET, Python)
Why automate
- Save time on repetitive tasks.
- Reduce human error.
- Standardize complex processes.

AutoLISP basics
- Load LISP files with APPLOAD.
- Use DEFUN to create commands.
- Use entget and entmod for entity read/write.

Sample LISP routine (concept)
- A routine to batch change layer colors for objects by type.
- A routine to rename blocks based on attribute values.

Scripts and batch commands
- Use .scr files for text-only command sequences.
- Use ScriptPro for batch script execution across files.

.NET and ObjectARX
- Use .NET for robust plugins with UI.
- Use Visual Studio to create Class Libraries.
- Use AutoCAD .NET API to interact with entities, documents, and UI.

Python and other languages
- Use automation bridges for Python to access COM or .NET APIs.
- Use Python for data processing and geometry export.

Custom UI, tool palettes, and macros
Tool palettes
- Use tool palettes for block and hatch libraries.
